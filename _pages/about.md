I am Huan Zhang, born in April 1994, currently is an associate research fellow in Zhengzhou University, master student's supervisor. I am the committee member of Causation and Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence of Chinese Association for Artificial Intelligence (CAAI), the communication committee member of the Machine Learning Committee of CAAI, and a member of CAAI, China Computer Federation (CCF), and Chinese Institute of Electronics (CIE). I received my Ph.D. degree in Geoscience Information Engineering from China University of Geosciences (CUG-Wuhan) in June 2023, supervised by Prof. [Liangxiao Jiang](https://grzy.cug.edu.cn/jlx/zh_CN/). Besides, I was a visiting student of Monash University from June 2022 to June 2023, supervised by IEEE Fellow, Prof. [Geoff Webb](https://i.giwebb.com/). My research interests mainly include machine learning, data mining, pattern recognition, etc, especially Bayesian network classifier, class-imbalanced learning, crowdsourcing learning, defect detection, situational awareness, etc. In recent years, I have published more than 10 papers in international and domestic journals recommended by CCF such as IEEE TKDE, SCIS, ACM TKDD, PR, INS, KAIS, PAKDD, etc. I have ever hosted or participated more than 10 projects of the National Natural Science Foundation of China, Hubei Province major science and technology projects, etc., and have long served as a reviewer and conference programmer for international journals and conference such as IEEE TNNLS, IEEE TCYB, ACM TKDD, PR, NEUNET, INS, DKE, AAAI, IJCAI, UAI, PRICAI, etc.

我是张欢，1994年4月生，目前担任郑州大学直聘副研究员，硕士研究生导师，中国人工智能学会机器学习专委会通讯委员、因果与不确定性人工智能专委会委员、中国计算机学会、中国人工智能学会、中国电子学会会员。我于2023年6月获得中国地质大学（武汉）工学博士学位，导师是[蒋良孝](https://grzy.cug.edu.cn/jlx/zh_CN/)教授，博士期间曾受国家留学基金委资助赴澳大利亚蒙纳士大学联合培养，导师为IEEE Fellow，[Geoff Webb](https://i.giwebb.com/)教授。我的研究兴趣主要集中在机器学习、数据挖掘、模式识别等领域，尤其是贝叶斯网络学习、类不平衡学习、众包学习、缺陷检测等。近年来，在IEEE TKDE, SCIS, ACM TKDD, PR, INS, KAIS, PAKDD等CCF推荐的国际、国内著名期刊和会议发表论文10余篇，主持或参与国家自然科学基金、湖北省揭榜制重大科技项目等项目10余项，长期担任IEEE TNNLS, IEEE TCYB, ACM TKDD, PR, NEUNET, INS, DKE, AAAI, IJCAI, UAI, PRICAI等国际期刊的审稿人和会议的程序委员会委员。
