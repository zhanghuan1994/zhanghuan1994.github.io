I am Huan Zhang, born in April 1994, currently is an associate research fellow in Zhengzhou University, master student's supervisor. I am the committee member of Causation and Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence of Chinese Association for Artificial Intelligence (CAAI), the communication committee member of the Machine Learning Committee of CAAI, and a member of CAAI, China Computer Federation (CCF), and Chinese Institute of Electronics (CIE). I received my Ph.D. degree in Geoscience Information Engineering from China University of Geosciences (CUG-Wuhan) in June 2023, supervised by Prof. [Liangxiao Jiang](https://grzy.cug.edu.cn/jlx/zh_CN/). Besides, I was a visiting student of Monash University from June 2022 to June 2023, supervised by IEEE Fellow, Prof. [Geoff Webb](https://i.giwebb.com/). My research interests mainly include machine learning, data mining, pattern recognition, etc, especially Bayesian network classifier, class-imbalanced learning, crowdsourcing learning, defect detection, situational awareness, etc. In recent years, I have published more than 10 papers in international and domestic journals recommended by CCF such as IEEE TKDE, SCIS, PR, KAIS, etc. I have ever participated in projects of the National Natural Science Foundation of China, Hubei Province major science and technology projects, etc., and have long served as a reviewer and conference programmer for international journals and conference such as IEEE TNNLS, IEEE TCYB, PR, NEUNET, INS, ESWA, KBS, EAAI, AIRE, NEUCOM, IJMLC, NEUCOM, NCAA, AAAI, UAI, PRICAI, etc.

我是张欢，1994年4月生，目前担任郑州大学直聘副研究员，硕士研究生导师，中国人工智能学会机器学习专委会通讯委员、因果与不确定性人工智能专委会委员、中国计算机学会、中国人工智能学会、中国电子学会会员。我于2023年6月获得中国地质大学（武汉）工学博士学位，导师是[蒋良孝](https://grzy.cug.edu.cn/jlx/zh_CN/)教授，博士期间曾受国家留学基金委资助赴澳大利亚蒙纳士大学联合培养，导师为IEEE Fellow，[Geoff Webb](https://i.giwebb.com/)教授。我的研究兴趣主要集中在机器学习、数据挖掘、模式识别等领域，尤其是贝叶斯网络学习、类不平衡学习、众包学习、缺陷检测等。近年来，在IEEE TKDE, SCIS, PR, KAIS等CCF推荐的国际和国内著名期刊发表论文10余篇，参与国家自然科学基金、湖北省揭榜制重大科技项目等，长期担任IEEE TNNLS, IEEE TCYB, PR, NEUNET, INS, ESWA, KBS, EAAI, AIRE, NEUCOM, IJMLC, NEUCOM, NCAA, AAAI, UAI, PRICAI等国际期刊的审稿人和会议的程序委员会委员。
