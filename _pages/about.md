I am Huan Zhang, born in April 1994, currently is an associate research fellow in Zhengzhou University, master student's supervisor. I am the communication committee member of the Machine Learning Committee of Chinese Association for Artificial Intelligence, and a member of China Computer Federation (CCF) and CCAI. I received my Ph.D. degree in Geoscience Information Engineering from China University of Geosciences (CUG-Wuhan) in June 2023, supervised by [Liangxiao Jiang](https://grzy.cug.edu.cn/jlx/zh_CN/). Besides, I was a visiting student of Monash University from June 2022 to June 2023, supervised by IEEE Fellow [Geoff Webb](https://i.giwebb.com/). My research interests mainly include machine learning, data mining, pattern recognition, etc, especially Bayesian network classifier, class-imbalanced learning, crowdsourcing learning, defect detection, etc. In recent years, I have published more than 10 papers in international and domestic journals recommended by CCF such as IEEE TKDE, SCIS, PR, INS, etc. I have ever participated in projects of the National Natural Science Foundation of China many times, and have long served as a reviewer and conference programmer for international journals and conference such as IEEE TNNLS, INS, ESWA, EAAI, IJMLC, NCAA, AAAI, PRICAI, etc.

我是张欢，1994年4月生，目前担任郑州大学直聘副研究员，硕士研究生导师，中国人工智能学会机器学习专委会通讯委员，中国计算机学会和人工智能学会会员。我于2023年6月获得中国地质大学（武汉）工学博士学位，导师是[蒋良孝](https://grzy.cug.edu.cn/jlx/zh_CN/)教授，博士期间曾受国家留学基金委资助赴澳大利亚蒙纳士大学联合培养，导师为IEEE Fellow，[Geoff Webb](https://i.giwebb.com/)教授。我的研究兴趣主要集中在机器学习、数据挖掘、模式识别等领域，尤其是贝叶斯网络学习、类不平衡学习、众包学习、缺陷检测等。近年来，在IEEE TKDE、SCIS、PR、INS等CCF推荐的国际和国内著名期刊发表论文10余篇，多次参与国家自然科学基金等项目，长期担任IEEE TNNLS、INS、ESWA、EAAI、IJMLC、NCAA、AAAI、PRICAI等国际期刊的审稿人和会议的程序委员会委员。
